# ppTorrents - Plausibly Private Torrents
The only privacy tool that works if you don't use it. No need for a VPN!

## How does it work?
ppTorrents runs a DHT node that receives infohashes from other peers. It selects a **random** set of discovered torrents and starts leeching/seeding.

## How does this provide privacy?
Because you can't choose what torrents it leeches & seeds. Anyone snooping on your BitTorrent traffic has no way to differentiate between torrents downloaded by you or ppTorrents. If a bad actor sees you in a specific swarm, you can simply claim that torrent was added by ppTorrents and not yourself.

## Why does this work without me using it?
Through the mere existence of ppTorrents, anyone claim to be running a client. No one can prove whether or not you actually are. If someone accuses you of downloading a torrent you're embarrassed about, just say you're using ppTorrents, even if you're not.

## So what now?
Bookmark this page. If someone says you downloaded or uploaded a torrent, just send them a link saying you were using this. Make sure to star the repo (even if you don't use it), so when someone gets told "I didn't download that, I used ppTorrents", it's more believable.

## Why even run the software?
Run ppTorrents if you are an honest man that doesn't want to lie about using a software you don't use.

Run ppTorrents if you are a generous man that wants to increase other people's plausible deniability about using ppTorrents when they aren't.

## What if no one uses it?
Doesn't matter! For all they know, it has 10 million users. They can't differentiate between ppTorrents and normal torrent activities.

## Will this work?
You get the same deniability as running a Tor node. If you can run a Tor node and not be accused of accessing a website, you can run a ppTorrent with the same level of plausible deniability.
